## About ##
GPLCart is an open source e-commerce platform based on the classical LAMP stack (Linux+ Apache+Mysql+PHP). It's free, simple, modern and extensible solution that allows you to build online-shops fast and easy. GplCart is not a fork of an existing software. It's completely unique, made "with blood, sweat and tears" from the scratch.

## Requirements ##

- PHP 5.4+, Mysql 5+, Apache 1+

Also you'll need the following extension enabled:

- Curl
- OpenSSL
- Mb string
- Mod Rewrite
- ZipArchive

## Installation ##

See INSTALL.txt

## Some key features ##
