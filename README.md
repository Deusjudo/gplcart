## WARNING. Dev branch in not for production. Please wait until the release of 1.X ##

## About ##
GPLCart is an open source e-commerce platform based on the classical LAMP stack (Linux+ Apache+Mysql+PHP). It is free, simple, modern and extensible solution that allows you to build online-shops fast and easy.

## Requirements ##

- PHP 5.4+, Mysql 5+, Apache 1+

Also you'll need the following extension enabled:

- Curl
- OpenSSL
- Mb string
- Mod Rewrite
- ZipArchive

## Installation ##

See INSTALL.txt

## Some key features ##

For developers:

- Simple MVC pattern
- PSR-0, PSR-4 standard compliance
- Dependency injection
- Minimum static methods
- Modules are damn simple, theme = module
- Tons of hooks
- Command line support (extensible)
- Ability to rewrite almost any core method from a module (no monkey patching, "VQ mods")
- Supports both PHP and TWIG templates (you can even mix them!)
- Supports versioned dependencies for modules and 3-d party libraries

For owners:

- Multistore `anotherstore.com, anotherstore.domain.com`
- International
- No stupid cart pages, just one checkout page
- True one page checkout that degrades gracefully if JS disabled
- Product classes
- Product fields (images, colors, text)
- Product combinations (XL + red, XL + green etc) with easiest management you've ever seen
- Powerful export/import for everything (*100.000* products on "3 bucks" hosting? No problem!)
- Super flexible price rules both for catalog and checkout (including coupons)
- Roles and access control
- Built-in template/css/js editor
- Backups
- Autogenerated URL aliases (with transliteration)
- Autogenerated SKU for every product combination (and they're unique per store)
- JS/CSS aggregation and compression
- Faster than any other popular shopping cart

...and much more!
